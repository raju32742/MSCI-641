My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.
She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
I bought this when I bought the pop maker.
As for "pop embellishing" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either.
Forget about any size paperback, it will not work.
